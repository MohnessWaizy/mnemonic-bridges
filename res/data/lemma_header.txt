This sample contains frequency information for every tenth word (word #131, 141, 151, etc) in the top 60,000 word list from iWeb.
-- The list is lemmatized, meaning that all "inflected" forms are included. For example, "get" (#41) is 
the combined frequency of get, gets, got, gotten, and getting.
-- There is also a "word forms" list, which has each form and its frequency as separate columns.

-- A word may appear multiple times in the list, each for a different part of speech (e.g. "strike" as a noun and as a verb).
-- Some words are parts of multi-word expressions, especially for adverbs ("r"), conjunctions ("c"), and prepositions ("i").
For example, "light" as a preposition (#6592) is part of the phrase "in light of".

* "wordID" corresponds in most cases to the ranking (1-60,000). It can safely be ignored in most cases, although it will provide a 
way to match up this data with the collocates or n-grams data.
* pos = part of speech (the first letter from the PoS codes at http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/claws7tags.html)
* "Range" is the percentage of the ~95,000 websites that have the word at least once.
* "Range10" is the percentage of the ~95,000 websites that have the word at least ten times.
* "Caps" is the percentage of forms of the word that are capitalized. This is especially useful for nouns, where 
capitalization is often a marker of proper nouns. (Proper nouns are not included in the list, but there are
many words that "straddle" the line between common and proper nouns, e.g. Rice/rice, Brown/brown, Beach/beach).
